## How we track work

### GitHub project tracker

The [GitHub project tracker](https://github.com/orgs/sourcegraph/projects/214) is the source of truth for all big items of work that the product and engineering team has planned.

There are a few tabs:

- The **product and engineering** tab tracks the results that the product and engineering VPs and directors review every week at the [VP team sync](#vp-team-sync).

### OKR slides

The OKR tracker slides are a living document that is updated once a week to communicate that current state of top level product and engineering key results for the current quarter. It only contains 1 week's worth of updates. Each slide has an owner, and that owner is responsible for updating that slide at the end of each week so it can be reviewed at the [VP team sync](#vp-team-sync) on Monday.

The slides are reviewed and discussed each week in the [VP team sync](#vp-team-sync) so we can celebrate wins, identify risks, and course correct if necessary.

After the slides are reviewed, they are copied to a seprate slide deck to capture week-over-week progress.

Slides:

## Retrospectives

The purpose of our quarterly retrospectives is to create a shared safe space for celebrating wins, learning, and improvement.

- Format:1 hr synchronous meeting
- Attendees:VPP/VPE & Product/Eng Directors
- Prework
  - DRI responsible for each KR fills out their retrospective slide in preparation for meeting
    - Collect input from your team
- During retrospective

  - Review OKRs & discuss outcomes

    - Goal: Understand whether or not we accomplished what we set out to accomplish this quarter
      - Celebrate achieved KRs and amplify the things that are working
      - Identify what didn’t work and discuss what we could have done

  - Roundtable discussion
    - Goal: leave room for open discussion around what else transpired not directly related to OKRs
      - What went well (wins) for yourself and for your team?
      - Did we accomplish what we said we were going to accomplish?
      - What didn’t go well (struggles and challenges) for yourself and for your team?
      - What did you and/or your team learn?

- Deliverable
  - Finalized OKR Scorecard deck ready to be shared with the company

## VP team sync
